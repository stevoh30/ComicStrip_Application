# Android Studio - Comic Strip Application

Capstone Project for Bachelors Degree in Application Development at Renton Technical College. 

This will be a mobile application for android devices that allows the user to select pictures from their personal photo gallery and input them into a selected comic strip template. The user can add dialogue boxes and text through a user-interface, allowing for the creation of personal stories. Created comics can either be saved in photo gallery or submitted on Instagram account.
